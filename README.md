# Flappy AI  

Flappy AI is a project that integrates the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm to create AI-controlled birds in the classic Flappy Bird game. The AI evolves over generations, learning to navigate obstacles and improve its gameplay.  

## Features  
- AI-driven gameplay using NEAT.  
- Real-time evolution and adaptation.  
- Built with Python and Pygame.  

## Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/udaykiran2427/Flappy-AI.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install pygame neat-python
   ```

3. Run the game:  
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
